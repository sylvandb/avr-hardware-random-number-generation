# True Random Number Generation Technique

## Introduction
From an upstream collection of code, data, and statistical testing of various AVR based hardware random number generators.

The original is a collection of information relating to the development, testing, and evaluation of various methods for generating true random numbers on an Atmel AVR microcontroller, though some of the techniques may prove useful on other devices.

Currently there are three separate projects upstream; Entropy, Avalanche, and Geiger. The only project stored here is the Entropy project, a library that will run on many 8-bit AVRs either standalone or within an Arduino environment.
